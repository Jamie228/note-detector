# Undergraduate Major Project
This application is capable of detecting musical notes C4 - C5 in crotchet notation in sheet music with a proven 94.6% accuracy against testing data.

The app was developed for the Undergraduate Major Project to answer the question "Is it Possible for a Mobile Application to Integrate Computer Vision to Accurately Identify Musical Notes from a Still or Moving Image?"

##Missing Files
The application is missing the .tflite file due to its size being too large for GitHub. It is hosted externally on Google Drive and should be placed in the assets/models folder when packaged.
